NOTE: This project is very preliminary, and requires some configuration before being usable.

### Quick Start

- Edit the registry settings in the project to point to your server
- Build with Visual Studio
- Grab Launcher.exe from the `bin` folder and place it in your GunBound installation folder

### Features

- Original Softnyx interface! Even includes the raon MessageBox (documentation pending).
- Thinned version of [gunbound-launcher](https://github.com/jglim/gunbound-launcher). Most of the technical details are in that repo.
- Most of the UI plumbing is already done. Just add logic! (and your own update mechanism)
